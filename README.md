## Introduction

The Mathematical Calculator project is designed to perform standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the calculator also keeps a record of the last two calculations, which can be accessed by the user to review recent operations.

## Technologies Used

- *HTML* - Provides the structure of the calculator interface.
- *CSS* - Styles the calculator layout and design for a user-friendly interface.
- *JavaScript* - Implements the functionality for performing calculations and storing the history of previous operations.
  
## Usage

Users can perform basic mathematical operations such as:
- *Addition*
- *Subtraction* 
- *Multiplication*
- *Division*

Additionally, the calculator stores the history of the last two operations, allowing users to review their recent calculations.
  
## Project Structure

The project has a basic structure:

<Pre>

│
├── index.html         # Main HTML file with the calculator structure
├── styles.css         # CSS file for design and layout of the calculator
├── app.js             # JavaScript for calculation logic and history tracking
</Pre>

- *index.html*: Defines the layout of the calculator buttons and display.
- *styles.css*: Contains styling rules to make the calculator responsive and visually appealing.
- *app.js*: Handles the core logic for mathematical operations and stores the last two calculation histories.
